A directory app to help view your employees.

## The Project

Employers need the ability to keep track of the employees they have on staff, especially if the company is large. This app is to quickly view them!

## Code Utilized

This project was constructed using: React | BootStrap | JavaScript | Random User API | CSS.

## What to Expect

When the Directory is loaded:
- The user will be presented with the title "Employee Directory" with a sub heading letting the user know that this is for navigating employees.
- Immediately following the title, there is a search bar in which the user can seach for any user by first name.
- Under the search bar, the table of employees is rendered and a list of 50 employees is shown.
- The user has the option to sort the table by first name, last name, or age.
- Once the user clicks the sort button, they will be given a prompt (input 'a' or 'd') to sort the selected column in ascending or descending order, respectively.

## Rendered Website

This application is deployed on GitHub Pages.

## License

This project is using MIT.

## Lessons Learned

I will again reiterate that React is a steep learning curve. I used hooks in this app, which I found very useful and quite handy in the big picture. There is still a lot to learn before I can say that I am comfortable using React, but I am getting there!

# More about React

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
